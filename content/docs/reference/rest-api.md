The NuoDB Control Plane REST API exposes access to resources in a hierarchical structure.

- An _organization_ contains several _projects_ and _users_.
- A _user_ is an entity that authenticates itself and issues requests to resources that it has been granted access to.
- A _project_ contains several _databases_ and enables both logical and physical separation between databases.
Databases belonging to the same project share resources associated with the project (i.e. a NuoDB domain), while databases in different projects do not share these resources and are more isolated from each other.
